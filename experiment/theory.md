### Introduction

The Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to determine whether a given string can be generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The algorithm was independently developed by John Cocke, Daniel Younger, and Tadao Kasami in the 1960s.

### Chomsky Normal Form

A context-free grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form if all production rules are of the form:
- A → BC (where A, B, and C are non-terminals)
- A → a (where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal)
- S → ε (where S is the start symbol and ε is the empty string)

### Algorithm Overview

The CYK algorithm works by building a triangular table (CYK table) where:
- The rows represent the length of the substring being considered
- The columns represent the starting position of the substring
- Each cell (i,j) contains the set of non-terminals that can generate the substring starting at position j with length i

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**: For each position i in the input string w:
   - Fill the first row with non-terminals that can generate the corresponding terminal

2. **Filling the Table**: For each cell (i,j):
   - Consider all possible ways to split the substring into two parts
   - For each split, check if there exists a production rule A → BC where:
     - B can generate the first part
     - C can generate the second part
   - If such a rule exists, add A to the cell (i,j)

3. **Acceptance**: The string is accepted if the start symbol S is in the cell (n,1), where n is the length of the input string

### Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n³|G|), where:
  - n is the length of the input string
  - |G| is the size of the grammar
- Space Complexity: O(n²|N|), where:
  - n is the length of the input string
  - |N| is the number of non-terminals

### Applications

The CYK algorithm is used in:
- Natural Language Processing
- Compiler Design
- Syntax Analysis
- Grammar Validation
- String Matching

### Example

Consider the grammar:
```
S → AB | BC
A → BA | a
B → CC | b
C → AB | a
```

And the input string "baaba"

The CYK table would be constructed as follows:
1. First row: Fill with terminals
2. Subsequent rows: Fill using the production rules
3. Check if S is in the top-right cell

The algorithm will determine whether "baaba" can be generated by the given grammar.
