      "question": "Given the grammar in CNF:\nS → AB | BC\nA → BA | a\nB → CC | b\nC → AB | a\nWhat is the first row of the CYK table for the input string 'baaba'?",
      "answers": {

        "d": "[{A}, {B}, {A}, {A}, {B}, {C}]"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. For 'baaba', we look at each terminal and find which non-terminals can generate it. 'b' can be generated by B, 'a' can be generated by A and C, so the first row is [{B}, {A}, {A}, {B}, {A}].",
        "b": "Incorrect. This sequence doesn't match the terminals in 'baaba'.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The first row should have 5 cells, one for each character in 'baaba'.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. For cell (2,1), we need to check the combination of (1,1) and (1,2) because we're looking at the substring 'ba' starting at position 1.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would skip the 'a' in position 2.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would start from position 2, not position 1.",

        "c": "Incorrect. Cell (5,5) would be out of bounds for a string of length 5.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Cell (3,1) only tells us about the substring 'baa', not about C.",
        "b": "Correct. Cell (3,1) containing {A, B} means the substring 'baa' can be generated by A and B.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Cell (2,4) is about a different substring.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Each cell can contain at most all non-terminals from the grammar.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The length of the input string doesn't limit the number of non-terminals in a cell.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. For a string of length 4, we need a 4x4 table where each cell (i,j) represents substrings of length i starting at position j.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The table size is determined by the string length, not the number of non-terminals.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The table is square, with dimensions equal to the string length.",

        "a": "Incorrect. We need to fill n² cells, but each cell may require multiple steps.",
        "b": "Correct. For each of the n² cells, we may need to check up to n different splits, leading to n³ steps.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The CYK algorithm is not exponential in time complexity.",
