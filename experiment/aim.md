The aim of this experiment is to help students understand and implement the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm for parsing context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form. Through this interactive simulation, students will:

1. Learn the fundamental concepts of the CYK algorithm
2. Understand how to construct and interpret the CYK parsing table
3. Practice applying the algorithm to determine if a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar
4. Visualize the step-by-step process of the algorithm
5. Gain hands-on experience with grammar parsing techniques

By the end of this experiment, students should be able to:
- Convert context-free grammars to Chomsky Normal Form
- Implement the CYK algorithm for grammar parsing
- Analyze the time and space complexity of the algorithm
- Apply the algorithm to solve real-world parsing problems
