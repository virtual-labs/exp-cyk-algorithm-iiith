        "a": "A grammar where each production rule has a single non-terminal on the left side",
        "b": "A grammar that can only generate regular languages",
        "c": "A grammar that requires context to generate strings",
        "d": "A grammar that can only generate finite languages"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. A context-free grammar is defined by having a single non-terminal on the left side of each production rule.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Context-free grammars can generate languages beyond regular languages.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The term 'context-free' means the rules can be applied regardless of context.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. In Chomsky Normal Form, all production rules are either of the form A → BC (where A, B, and C are non-terminals) or A → a (where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal).",
        "b": "Incorrect. CNF is a form of context-free grammar, not a restriction to regular languages.",

        "a": "Incorrect. The cell represents more than just the length of the substring.",
        "b": "Correct. Each cell (i,j) contains the set of non-terminals that can generate the substring starting at position j with length i.",

        "a": "Incorrect. The presence of any non-terminal in the last cell is not sufficient.",
        "b": "Correct. A string is accepted if and only if the start symbol S is present in the cell (n,1), where n is the length of the input string.",
